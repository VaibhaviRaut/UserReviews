"As someone else mentioned, the directions do not keep up with your physical movement. The GPS dot moves all over the place even if you are standing in one spot making it extremely difficult to get your bearings in an unfamiliar place. I may not know where I am, but I do know where I am not (...unless the men's fragrance section of Macy's has been moved outdoors and a block over). Adding to the challenge, the street names can be difficult to find. You may have to zoom out a significant amount for the one you are looking for to appear. God forbid you want to zoom out and look for something in another area. Every time I have tried recently, it just brings me back to the area I'm currently in.",1,"Thanks for your review!

"This app is garbage. It’s been out for years and they don’t fix basic algorithm mistakes like how it arbitrarily decides to omit immediate-next turns (and then you drive to the wrong borough and you’re twenty minutes later than you would be if you were using something other than garbage), or it tells you to be in any number of lanes to make a turn or an exit when there is really only one acceptable lane to be in to not kill everyone trying to drive around you, or it doesn’t tell you that the highway you’re on drops a lane, or it wastes time telling you that the next thing you need to do is merge when the only thing in the world you could physically ever do at that juncture IS merge (or just dunk your car in a ditch and be done with driving altogether).",0,
"Let’s get one thing straight: I love google. I use Google Chrome over safari, Google Calendar over the one that comes with iPhone, and for a long time, I used Google Maps over Apple Maps. Google Maps a year ago was amazing. It always knew right where I was, the voice notifications were brief and prompt, and the app overall was just easy to use. Fast forward to today. Maps only communicates in NSEW directions “Head East” (Who knows that?), the voice notification system is mediocre at best, and to say that Google Maps is glitchy is an understatement. I just went to a new city and drove my car around, and more often than not I was slinging my car across four lanes of traffic trying to make an exit that Google didn’t let me know I needed to take, or saying that I was on the wrong side of the road, going the wrong way or off the road entirely into the bushes (all the while I had at least 3 bars of LTE on Verizon. Coverage and carrier were not the issue). That was the final straw. This app that used to be more helpful was now potentially putting my life (and the life of my grandmother and friend) at risk. I still refuse to use Apple Maps, and have joined Waze. If the glitches can be fixed I may use again, but overall I am very disappointed!",0,
"Since introduction of this app, it used to be a reliable, accurate, and just plain awesome! The past 8-10 months I have noticed how this app now like to loop you in directions that lead to paying tolls twice and directs you to areas where there are police traps set up. This does not happen just in my home state, but all over the country where I drive. While in Boston, the app was just plain unusable.",0,
"From avoiding traffic to drop off the kiddos to finding the fastest route (again avoiding traffic) on my 45+ min. commute, and often searching for the closest gas, food, <insert business> along the way — rinse and repeat at the end of the day — Google Maps is not just a handy app, it’s essential to my everyday comings and goings. The traffic notifications are absurdly simple (dark red road = bad) and always seem to be accurate, while it’s an excellent resource for doing basic research on pretty much any place, anywhere. Works great on my iPhone, very rarely glitches, and the option to download local maps “just in case” ensures I’m getting where I need to be regardless. I prefer to use it as a search tool even when I’m not traveling because of all the details, contact info, etc. it provides in an uber simple UI. Great for piece of mind on a daily basis, and that’s not even getting into the “fun” stuff like using street view to check out places and just exploring while on the toilet. Privacy / location tracking options are easy to control too, and the list goes on. Why wouldn’t I use Google Maps?",0,
"The way you’re allowing people to report accidents or road closures now with the + only available when the app is in route navigation mode is absolutely idiotic. You’re assuming people always open up maps to have turn by turn navigation going on when they need to file such a report and that’s simply not the case. I don’t need navigation to know where I’m going almost 90% of the time, but it would be nice to open up maps, drop a pin and add an accident or speed trap if I see one along my way WITHOUT having to be in navigation mode on the maps. Why you didn’t think of this is beyond me.",1,Let's give clearing your phones cache and restarting your phone to possibly improve this issue for you like it has for others.

"It took me to streets that were closed! My kids had a field trip, and the 101 fwy was closed in Santa Barbara. I already knew this, so I wanted to make sure I leave early enough to take whatever detours I had to take. Google maps said I would make it in 2.5 hours, and showed that I'd be using side streets where the fwy was closed. I checked Waze (another GPS app) and that said it would take me 3.5 hours, taking me the 5 fwy route. So I opted for Google Maps, the faster one, the so-called ""trusted"" GPS app, that would get me there 1 hour sooner than Waze's route. We left early, and when we reached the part where the fwy was closed, it detoured me to streets that were closed off! Tried other streets, all closed!! I then used Waze, to see if there was another way, and Waze said I would have to go all the way around, through the 5 fwy. That would take me 4 hours from where I was! We obviously didn't make it to our field trip and ended up just going to a park in Santa Barbara, then headed back home. I should have used Waze from the beginning. Google Maps fail!",0,
"Google Maps is helpful, probably, when one is driving. It's not helpful for someone who has to take transit or walk. Transit often has changes/transfers - there are no actual walking directions available that are helpful. If you're walking the wrong way, the app doesn't stop you, just tells you to walk to {location}. Also, some bus stops are very near/across the street from one another and Google Maps has a hard time pinpointing that. That's the difference between going the wrong way in a strange place or arriving at your destination.",1,"Thank you for your review! Sorry to hear about this issue.

"I guess I didn't even realize the difference between this and the native apple map. I switched to iPhone last year and was used to pressing a map link and it opened right up in maps. Well, apple does that too...but when I needed it badly I had to come download google maps. I was stuck in a delivery parking lot of a huge hospital in an unfamiliar city that apparently had one address for the whole campus. Apple's map made me almost lose my mind- ""Turn right then turn right! Go southwest then immediately go north then turn right! Turn left then turn right!""",0,
"For the vast majority of usage, this app has been flawless. The traffic is accurate, the routing is good, and the user interface is simple and easy to use. However, I have found some things to be quite annoying. For one, I have found that sometimes when I am in the far left lane on the highway, the app will think I am on the wrong side of the road causing it to constantly reroute me (this mostly happens in HOV lanes and high speed ezpass lanes).",0,
